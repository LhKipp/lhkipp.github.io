title: Shell | cd's .. has different semantics
---

`cd relative_path (not including ..)` and `cd ..` have different semantics. For the first it is: Following symlinks, for the second it is: 'Take me one path back, from where I came'

Example directory structure: A/B/C and there is a symlink in A pointing to C.
```shell
sh-5.1$ sh --version
